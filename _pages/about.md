I am a postdoctoral researcher within the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Strathclyde. My research interests include using Computational Fluid Dynamics to study ship hydrodynamics, such as scale effects and shallow or confined watter effects on ship performance.

This website will eventually be populated fully with information.
