Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher within the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Strathclyde. My research interests include using Computational Fluid Dynamics to study ship hydrodynamics, such as scale effects and shallow or confined watter effects on ship performance.

# Research interests

All things CFD, but more specifically:
- Scale effects, or discrepencies caused by dissimilarities in dimensionless groups
- Shallow and confined water effects on ship hydrodynamics
- Wavemaking 
- Turbulence
- Discretisation uncertainty

# Collaboration

I am always looking to collaborate on research, and would be delighted to discuss potential collaborations. If you have any questions about my existing work, need access to any of my research, or would like to discuss ideas you can get in touch by [emailing me](mailto:momchil.terziev@strath.ac.uk). You can also get in touch informally through [twitter](https://twitter.com/m_terziev).

# Students
