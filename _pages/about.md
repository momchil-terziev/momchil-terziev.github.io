Welcome! I am a postdoctoral researcher within the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Strathclyde. My research interests include using Computational Fluid Dynamics to study ship hydrodynamics, such as scale effects and shallow or confined watter effects on ship performance.

# Research interests

All things CFD, but more specifically:
- Scale effects, or discrepencies caused by dissimilarities in dimensionless groups
- Shallow and confined water effects on ship hydrodynamics
- Wavemaking 
- Turbulence
- Discretisation uncertainty
