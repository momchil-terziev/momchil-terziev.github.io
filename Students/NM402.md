## Lab example two: numerical friction line

The aim here will be to reproduce [the numerical friction line](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00773-008-0018-1) by fitting a curve to CFD data provided by students. The general form of the equation will be:

$$C_F=a/(\log_{10}(Re)+b)^c$$

where $$Re = U\rho L/\mu$$ is the Reynolds number, $$U$$ is the free stream flow speed in $$m/s$$, $$\rho = 997.561 kg/m^3$$ is the water density, $$\mu = 8.8871\times10^{-4} Pa-s$$ is the dynamic viscosity of water, and $$L = 1 m$$ is the plate length. Our task will be to determine the coefficients $$a, b, c$$ by using the MATLAB curve fitting toolbox. We will then decide on the name of the equation through a voting system.

Each student will use a different Reynolds number in the range $$10^5 < Re < 10^8$$. The script below will provide the first layer thickness and free stream velocity for each case.
