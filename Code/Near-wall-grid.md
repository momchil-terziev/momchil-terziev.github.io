## Background
The app uses the method for setting a grid described in my [full-scale review paper](/publication/review-paper-scale-effects). The approach uses the fact that the frictional resistance coefficient ($$C_f$$) may be expressed by using the Reynolds number ($$Re$$). Here we do not make a distinction between the local frictional resistance coefficient $$C_f$$ and the integral frictional resistance coefficient $$C_F$$.

### Frictional resistance coefficient estimation methods
The following methods can be used at present:

| Identifier | Equation |
| ---- | -------- |
| ITTC |  $$C_f=0.075/(log_{10}(Re)-2)^{2}$$  |
| Prandtl |  $$C_f=0.074Re^{-1/5}$$  |
| Telfer |  $$C_f=0.34Re^{-1/3}+0.0012$$  |
| Landweber |  $$C_f=0.0816/(log_{10}(Re)-1.703)^2$$  |
| Hughes |  $$C_f=0.067/(log_{10}(Re)-1.703)^2$$  |
| Gadd |  $$C_f=0.0113/(log_{10}(Re)-3.7)^{1.15}$$  |
| Granville |  $$C_f=0.0776/(log10(Re)-1.88)^2+60/Re$$  |

### Calculation
Once the line to calculate $$C_f$$ is chosen, the shear stress is predicted as: 

$$\tau_w=C_f\rho U^2/2$$

Then, the first layer thickness is calculated using the desired $$y^+$$ through: 

$$dy=y^+\nu/\surd(t_w/\rho)$$

where $$\nu$$ is the kinematic viscosity. We must now distribute layers over a user-specified distance. We do this through the boundary layer thickness 

$$\delta_x=x0.382L/Re^{1/5}$$

where $$L$$ is the ship length, and $$x%$$ is the % of the boundary layer we wish to distribute layers over. 

There is no point on distrubuting layers of constant thickness equal to $$dy$$ over the distance $$\delta_x$$ because this would result in using unnecessarily many layers. Instead, it is possible (within Star-CCM+) to express the layer distribution as a geometric progression, whose common ratio is $$S$$, a user-defined value between $$1$$ and $$\infty$$, and whose sum is the thickness over which we wish to distribute cells. The number of cells we need is then 

$$n=log[\delta(S-1)/(2dy)]/log(S)$$

Note that we use $$2dy$$ instead of $$dy$$ because the cell centre must be located at a distance of $$dy$$ from the wall.

The only drawback is that we need an integer number of layers and rounding up may cause some small disagreement between the target $$y^+$$ and the desired $$y^+$$. In general, this discrepency can be expected to be in the region of up to 20% for low $$y^+$$ meshes and about 5 $$y^+$$ units for high $$y^+$$ meshes.

## User interface
The app appears as follows when installed
![UI](https://momchil-terziev.github.io/files/wallapp.png)
 
- The Help button opens this page
- âœ… if the tickbox is ticked, the Run analysis button displays the results from all methods to predict $$C_f$$ in the command window
