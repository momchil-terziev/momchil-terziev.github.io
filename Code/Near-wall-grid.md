## Method
The app uses the method for setting a grid described in my [full-scale review paper](/publication/review-paper-scale-effects). The approach uses the fact that the frictional resistance coefficient (_C<sub>f</sub>_) may be expressed by using the Reynolds number (_Re_). Here we do not make a distinction between the local frictional resistance coefficient _C<sub>**f**</sub>_ and the integral frictional resistance coefficient _C<sub>**F**</sub>_.
