# Introduction

After I recorded some tutorials for students on MS Stream, I had to download the transcript. The transcript looked as shown below:

| As shown on MS stream | As downloaded |

# Code

At the time, I didn't know there is an online tool able to remove the additional text, so I wrote a bit of code. Later, I added a graphical user interface. You can get the app and function code in the table below:

| Type  | Description | Requirements | Link | Instructions |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---- | ----- |
| **MATLAB app**  | A MATLAB app with a graphical user interface  | No coding or MATLAB background requirements. See the documentation below for details on how to install and run the app | [Download app](https://momchil-terziev.github.io/Code/Transcript%20processing%20app.mlappinstall) | How to install and use the app |
| **MATLAB function**  | A MATLAB function for those who prefer code. The function has identical functionality to the app  | Minimal coding requirements, see below for details       | [Download function](https://momchil-terziev.github.io/Code/processTranscript.mlx) | [How to use the function]() |
