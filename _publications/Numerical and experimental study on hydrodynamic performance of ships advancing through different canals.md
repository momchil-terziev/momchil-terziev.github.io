### Abstract

In international shipping, there are several waterways that are widely viewed as bottlenecks. Among these is the Suez Canal, where recent expansions have taken place. Although the Suez Canal has a high importance in international shipping, little research has been carried out in maximising the number of ships capable of traversing for a set period of time. The present study aims to examine hydrodynamic phenomena of ships advancing through the Suez Canal in the allowed speed range to determine the relative effects of the canal depth and/or width restrictions on the overall ship sailing performance. A rectangular canal is also included as a reference to gauge the effects of varying canal cross-section. The present study combines experimental, numerical, analytical and empirical methods for a holistic approach in calm water. As a case-study, the KCS hullform is adopted, and analysed experimentally, via …

### Highlights

- Experimental, numerical, analytical and empirical techniques campaign was performed for the KCS in shallow water.
- Restricted and dredged channels were modelled in tests.
- Scaling performed geometrically and by a change in the value of viscosity.
- The sinkage, trim and resistance values were measured.
