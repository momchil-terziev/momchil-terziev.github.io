### Abstract

With the rapid advent of computational methods in all fields of engineering, several areas have emerged as significant sources of ambiguity. Among these is the selection of a turbulence model to close the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations. In ship hydrodynamics, this has been particularly difficult to resolve due to the complex nature of the problem. The present study aims to alleviate the ambiguity inherent in the field. This is done by performing a series of tests on turbulence models and comparing the outcomes with experimental results. The results are analysed via a modified bivariate plot, which reveal a strong candidate for the optimum choice of turbulence modelling. The time per iteration also points towards the same candidate, identified as the standard _k-Ï‰_ model, as a good choice within the software used to perform the analysis.
