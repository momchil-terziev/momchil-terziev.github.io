App: MS Stream transcript processing

### Description
When we edit transcripts on MS Stream, we download a text file containing the edits. Then, we usually wish to remove the confidence intervals and timing of the text. Instead, we want to give the transcript as simple text. The here documented app aims to acocmplish this by using MATLAB. No background programming is necessary.
