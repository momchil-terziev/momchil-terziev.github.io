## Issue 1: Plotting short-term statistics against peak period

Short term statistics display data in terms of the peak period shown below:

![Short term statistics: Heave std against Tp](https://momchil-terziev.github.io/files/Pasted image 20220127194638.png)

However, this is only when the significant wave height is kept constant for a varying peak period:

If combinations of significant wave height and peak period are chosen instead, the x-axis becomes Hs, and it is currently not possible to switch to peak period:
