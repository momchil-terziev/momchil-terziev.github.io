## Importing from Rhino and AutoCAD

A good example of what the geometry should look like when using a design from Rhino or AutoCAD is given below:

**_Key points:_**

· The geometry is comprised of lines; there are no surfaces or rogue points.
· No point on the geometry is below _z_ = 0. If this is the case for your design, you must elevate the stations above _z_ = 0.
· The stations are not closed: there is no line connecting the tops of stations from port to starboard.
